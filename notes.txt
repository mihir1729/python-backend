Python
- fastest growing programming language in the world
- fields unlocked - machine learning and AI, web development

first line of code in file app.py
print('hello world')

print('My name is mihir, my age is', 100) -> tells python once the string ends, it is followed by a number/integer, it also automatically leaves space post the comma

Variables
name = 'Tim'				//variable declaration

print(name + ' is a boy')		//this is called concatenation of variable with string
print(name + ' is 18')
print(name + ' is from turkey')
print(name)

Data Types
integer, boolean, character, string

age = 18
print(name + ' is ' + age)		//it throws error as string cannot be concatenated with an integer

print(name + ' is', age)		//here it works as we separate the integer with comma

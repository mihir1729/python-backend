Python
- fastest growing programming language in the world
- fields unlocked - machine learning and AI, web development

first line of code in file app.py
print('hello world')

print('My name is mihir, my age is', 100) -> tells python once the string ends, it is followed by a number/integer, it also automatically leaves space post the comma

Variables
name = 'Tim'				//variable declaration

print(name + ' is a boy')		//this is called concatenation of variable with string
print(name + ' is 18')
print(name + ' is from turkey')
print(name)

Data Types
integer, boolean, character, string

age = 18
print(name + ' is ' + age)		//it throws error as string cannot be concatenated with an integer

print(name + ' is', age)		//here it works as we separate the integer with comma

print(name, 'is' , age)			//this also works as string can be separated with comma as well as + sign

Strings
These are plain text.

print('Hi.\nHow are you')		//here backslash n continues the string values in the new line

In between single quotes, we cannot add a quote inside the string value. 
print('Hi. \'How are you')		//but with backslash, python reads the next characted which is a quote as string value only
